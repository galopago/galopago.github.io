If the vast prototyping area isn’t enough, female pin headers could be soldered and an expansion board could be plugged in. Notice that RAK811-LF and RAK811-HF have slighter differences in some i/o pins  Antenna options Internal spring antena soldered on J6, JP2  jumper positions 1-2 shorted.

Sample application   	   	   	   	Magnetic Switch LoRa sensor node   The sample applications consist in a LoRa magnetic switch sensor which transmits a packet when the switch opens or closes.

If the vast prototyping area isn’t enough, female pin headers could be soldered and an expansion board could be plugged in.Notice that RAK811-LF and RAK811-HF have slighter differences in some i/o pinsAntenna optionsInternal spring antena soldered on J6, JP2  jumper positions 1-2 shorted.External antenna using U.FL. connector, JP2 jumper positions 2-3 shorted.ProvisioningAs the code was derived from a RAK Wireless existing product, it uses de same AT commands for provisioning using UART. Here is the  manual with the complete AT commands.Sample application	  	  	  	Magnetic Switch LoRa sensor nodeThe sample applications consist in a LoRa magnetic switch sensor which transmits a packet when the switch opens or closes.

<h3 id="customization">Customization</h3>
<p>The project is divided in four main aspects: power source, enclosure, antenna and expansion which can be modified for the exact requirements. Finally a sample application is given as a way to show how to implement your own sensor solution.</p>

<h5 id="power-source">Power source</h5>
<p>The device can work from 1.8v up to 3.7v. There are many alternatives to power it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2 x AA alkaline batteries. JP1 jumper positions 1-2 shorted.</li>
  <li>1 x 14500 lithium battery. JP1 jumper positions 2-3 shorted. The BT2 battery holder could be removed, freeing up some PCB space.</li>
  <li>External power applied to J1 screw terminal. BT1 and BT2 battery holders could be removed, freeing up even more PCB space.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="enclosure">Enclosure</h5>
<p>The PCB fits inside a “generic” unbranded <strong>83x58x33mm</strong> waterproof plastic enclosure. These enclosures came in multiple flavors: gray, white, black, clear lid, wall mounting tabs. The board is fixed to the enclosure by two self tapping screws.</p>

<h5 id="expansion">Expansion</h5>

	<figcaption>PCB expansion area</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The prototyping area contains through hole soldering pads routed to all pins of RAK811 module, plus  some small amount of free connected pads for prototyping. Connections for outside detachable sensors are provided via W,X,Y,Z screw terminals. If the vast prototyping area isn’t enough, <a href="https://rimstar.org/science_electronics_projects/pin_headers_soldering_cutting_male_female.htm">female pin headers</a> could be soldered and an expansion board could be plugged in.
Notice that RAK811-LF and RAK811-HF have slighter differences in some i/o pins</p>

<h5 id="antenna-options">Antenna options</h5>
<p>Internal spring antena soldered on J6, JP2  jumper positions 1-2 shorted.<br />
External antenna using U.FL. connector, JP2 jumper positions 2-3 shorted.</p>

<h5 id="provisioning">Provisioning</h5>
<p>As the code was derived from a RAK Wireless existing product, it uses de same AT commands for provisioning using UART. Here is the  <a href="/assets/pdf/RAK811_AT_Command_Manual_V1.0.pdf">manual</a> with the complete AT commands.</p>

	<figcaption>Magnetic Switch LoRa sensor node</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The sample applications consist in a LoRa magnetic switch sensor which transmits a packet when the switch opens or closes. A very small reed switch is installed in one of the walls inside enclosure.
Breakout board  was used to install the supplementary electronic components: Led indicator, pullup resistors, test button, and voltage divider for battery monitoring.</p>

<p>Any other kind of switch sensor (<a href="http://blog.vidianindhita.com/2018/02/27/all-about-tilt-switches/">ball inclination sensor, spring vibration sensor</a>, etc.) could be added!</p>

<p>PVDF wire was used to make connections because the insulation resists pretty well soldering iron abuse!.
